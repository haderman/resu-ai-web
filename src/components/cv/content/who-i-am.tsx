Iâ€™m a Front End Developer and I am very adaptive to different ways of working.
I believe that the most important thing is to learn the basics very well and determine
the best approach for the team and the product overall. I love to have side projects
to experiment with new technologies and to practice new things that
I learn on my way. I really love what I do and I am continuously learning
and developing my skills.
